Build
=====

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mtotschnig/MyExpenses.git
cd MyExpenses
export ANDROID_HOME={sdk-dir}
./gradlew build
```

If gradlew gives you a "Failed to install the following Android SDK packages"
error message, the packages can be installed manually with commands such as:

```sh
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --install --sdk_root=$ANDROID_HOME "platforms;android-32"
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --install --sdk_root=$ANDROID_HOME "build-tools;30.0.3"
```

If gradlew errors out with "Could not dispatch a message to the daemon", just
re-run the command. This can happen when the system is low on memory. The same
is true for the "Gradle build daemon disappeared unexpectedly" error.
